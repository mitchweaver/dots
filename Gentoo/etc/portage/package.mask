# ============ OVERLAY MASKS ==============================
# Note: for reason why I do this,
#
# When you add an overlay, that gets added to emerge's search
# for new packages -- globally. That means if a "new" version
# of a package gets added to an overlay, it will prefer that
# over gentoo's default. This could be a security concern
# for example someone could push malware to their overlay
# with a version of "gzip-v5000" and it would get grabbed
# by portage as being an "update"
#
# Better solution is have a default blacklist all and only
# whitelist specific packages you want to install from the
# overlay. This in MY OPINION should be the DEFAULT...
