# X1 Carbon 7th Gen

Here's a kernel config for 7th gen X1C

Was made with genkernel and then edited to fix some things.  
Don't yell at me that it has a bunch of crap in it.  
I just wanted the damn thing to work.

----

Everything is functional.  
wireless, touchpad, suspend, brightness... etc

make issue for any questions
